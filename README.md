The smart car is a highly computerized automobile featuring ubiquitous computing, intuitive human-computer interaction and an open application platform. Here, we propose an advanced Smart Car demonstration platform with a transparent windshield display and various motion sensors where drivers can manipulate a variety of car-appropriate applications in augmented reality. Similar to smartphones, drivers can customize their Smart Car through free downloads of car-appropriate applications according to their wants and needs.
